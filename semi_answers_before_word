1.1
(5*5+1)*32
(5*5+1)*64
(7*7*64+1)*1024
(1024+1)*10

and do sum on it

1.2
1_2_accuracy

2
2_2_and_3accuracy
2.2
linear faster , non linear better!

2.3
big gap (maybe over fitting)

3 TODO maybe reduce channels.
3.1.1
(3*3+1)*32 + (28*28*32+1)*10

3.1.2
3_1_2_loss

3.2.1
(3*3+1)*32+(7*7*32+1)*10

3.2.2
the smaller network converged faster but with lower accuracy score
